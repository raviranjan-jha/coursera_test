		The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and
email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information,
and it’s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
Again, you need to do this only once if you pass the --global option, because
then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system.
If you want to override this with a dierent name or email address for specific
projects, you can run the command without the --global option when
you’re in that project.
Many of the GUI tools will help you do this when you first run them.

	You should have a basic understanding of what Git is and how it’s dierent from
the centralized version control system you may have previously been using. You
should also now have a working version of Git on your system that’s set up with
your personal identity. It’s now time to learn some Git basics.

		If you can read only one chapter to get going with Git, this is it. This chapter
covers every basic command you need to do the vast majority of the things
you’ll eventually spend your time doing with Git. By the end of the chapter, you
should be able to configure and initialize a repository, begin and stop tracking
files, and stage and commit changes. We’ll also show you how to set up Git to
ignore certain files and file patterns, how to undo mistakes quickly and easily,
how to browse the history of your project and view changes between commits,
and how to push and pull from remote repositories.

		If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository – for example, a project
you’d like to contribute to – the command you need is git clone. If you’re familiar
with other VCS systems such as Subversion, you’ll notice that the command
is “clone” and not “checkout”. This is an important distinction – instead
of getting just a working copy, Git receives a full copy of nearly all data that the
server has. Every version of every file for the history of the project is pulled
down by default when you run git clone. In fact, if your server disk gets corrupted,
you can oen use nearly any of the clones on any client to set the server
back to the state it was in when it was cloned (you may lose some server-side
hooks and such, but all the versioned data would be there – see “Getting Git
on a Server” for more details).

		That creates a directory named “libgit2”, initializes a .git directory inside it,
pulls down all the data for that repository, and checks out a working copy of the
latest version. If you go into the new libgit2 directory, you’ll see the project
files in there, ready to be worked on or used. If you want to clone the repository
into a directory named something other than “libgit2”, you can specify that as
the next command-line option:
